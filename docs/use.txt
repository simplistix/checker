Using Checker
=============

.. invisible-code-block: python

  from testfixtures import should_raise,compare
  from checker.tests.base import OpenRaisesContext,ConfigContext
  from checker.tests.base import OutputtingContext
  from checker import main

Once installed, checker is used by executing the checker script.
This will look for a configuration, by default located in
:file:`/config`. The configuration location can be overriden with a
command line options to the checker script::

  checker -C /some/folder

.. -> command

.. invisible-code-block: python

  from __future__ import with_statement
  with OpenRaisesContext(command.split()) as c:
      should_raise(main,IOError("'/some/folder/checker.txt' 'rU'"))()

.. _configuration-folder:

Within the configuration folder, Checker looks for a file called
:file:`checker.txt` that contains a list of rows defining the
configurations to be checked, for example::

  path:/some/folder
  path:/some/file
  
  # blank lines and lines starting with hashes are ignored.
  crontab:root
  svn:/some/checkout
  buildout:/some/buildout

.. -> checker_txt

.. invisible-code-block: python

  from __future__ import with_statement
  with ConfigContext() as c:
      c.run_with_config(checker_txt)
      # order matters here!
      c.check_checkers_called(
                ('path',(c.dir.path,'/some/folder',),{}),
                ('path',(c.dir.path,'/some/file',),{}),
                ('crontab',(c.dir.path,'root',),{}),
                ('svn',(c.dir.path,'/some/checkout',),{}),
                ('buildout',(c.dir.path,'/some/buildout',),{}),
                ('svn',(c.dir.path,c.dir.path,),{}),
      )

Each one of these lines starts with the name of a checker followed by
a colon. The remainder of the line is passed through to the checker
for it to find the configuration information it should be checking.
The checker may then write information to the configuration directory.

Once all the checkers have been run, an implict checker is run on the
configuration folder itself. By default, the `svn` checker is used,
but you can override this with a line in your :file:`checker.txt` as
follows::

  config_checker:buildout

.. -> checker_txt

.. invisible-code-block: python

  from __future__ import with_statement
  with ConfigContext() as c:
      c.run_with_config(checker_txt)
      c.check_checkers_called(
                ('buildout',(c.dir.path,c.dir.path,),{}),
      )

At the moment, the only sensible choices for the implicit checker are
`svn`, `buildout` or `svn,buildout` to indicate the `svn` checker
should be used followed by the `buildout` checker::

  config_checker:svn,buildout

.. -> checker_txt

.. invisible-code-block: python

  from __future__ import with_statement
  with ConfigContext() as c:
      c.run_with_config(checker_txt)
      c.check_checkers_called(
                ('svn',(c.dir.path,c.dir.path,),{}),
                ('buildout',(c.dir.path,c.dir.path,),{}),
      )



.. note::

  The implicit checker is run only once all other checkers have been
  run. This means that if you have changes committed to the
  configuration folder that are not present in the working copy, they
  will only be retrieved once all other checkers have been run and so
  may only been show up in checker notifications when Checker is next
  run.

By default, any changes found by a checker are printed to stdout. This
makes Checker ideal for running as a nightly cron job where the output
will be emailed to the user running the cron job.

.. it's not important to show in the docs, but a doctest is a really
   good way of showing the output to stdout:

   >>> from logging import getLogger
   >>> with OutputtingContext() as c:
   ...   c.run_with_config('')
   checker.checkers.real.check
   checker.checkers.svn.check
 
   OutputtingContext provides the checker to run, and we get the
   default svn one too.

However, on some systems, output from scheduled tasks is not emailed
to the user running the task. In this case, some special lines may be
added to :file:`checker.txt` as follows::

  email_to: recipient1@example.com,recipient2@example.com
  email_from: sender@example.com
  email_subject: Checker output from myhost
  email_smtphost: smtp.example.com

.. -> checker_txt

.. invisible-code-block: python

  from __future__ import with_statement
  with OutputtingContext() as c:
      c.run_with_config(checker_txt)
      c.check_email_config(
          'sender@example.com',
          ['recipient1@example.com', 'recipient2@example.com'],
          'Checker output from myhost',
          'smtp.example.com',
          )

Only `email_to` is required, and once specified, if the other options
are not present, the following defaults will be used:

`email_from`
  The `email_to` value will be used if no `email_from` is supplied.

`email_subject`
  If not specified, the subject will default to the text::
 
    Checker output
   
  followed by the hostname of the machine on which Checker is run.

`email_smtphost`
  This defaults to `localhost`.
