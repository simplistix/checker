1.4 (26 Sep 2010)
-----------------

- add the generic :command:`command` checker.

1.3 (15 Jul 2010)
-----------------

- switch to using the :mod:`execute` package.

- generalize the :command:`dpkg` checker into an `os_packages`
  checker. The result is that the :command:`dpkg` checker no longer
  exists.

1.2 (29 Dec 2009)
-----------------

- Supply :command:`LC_COLLATE="C"` before calling :command:`ls` to
  make sure entries the :file:`.listing` files generated by the `path`
  checker are in a consistent order no matter which user runs
  :command:`checker`.

1.1 (20 Dec 2009)
-----------------

- Fix bug in `init` checker; :command:`update-rc.d` must be called
  with its full path to work from cron.
